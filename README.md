# Q3 Galvanize Project - Registree - By John Savone

My 3rd Quarter final project that took 4.5 days to complete. It's an app that allows users to create a registry that gives their guests price comparison options with multiple stores. Front end was built with React, Redux, and Material-ui. Back end was built with Express, Node, Knex, and a PostgreSQL database.
